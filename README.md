        These bots provide free <b>Numerade, Scribd, </b>and <b>Slideshare</b> answers. All you need to do is copy the link and paste it into these bots, and after 2-3 seconds, you'll have the answer. The answers are shortened using a URL shortener that includes ads for me to benefit, but it's safe to use because it directly leads to the answer and there's a tutorial on how to unlock it right from the start of the bot. Enjoy using my bots, you can use them for yourself or even sell the answers you get here.
